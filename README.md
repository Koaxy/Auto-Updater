A C-Sharp Auto Updater.

Basically What this does, is grabs a file from a webserver with say for example the version, downloads that file to a text document, and on launch checks for if that webserver document has changed. if so it will force an update on the user, to make sure they are on the correct version of your software at all times, also comes with an automated extracter, you will need to install the dependancies

You'll need these in order to extract a rar archive.
And youll also need a webserver in order to be able to get the updates.
